# RHODS x MONAI

This repository documents my project as a Red Hat intern (summer 2022). 
This projects aims to demonstrate the app development capabilities using 
RHODS (Red Hat Openshift Data Science) by leveraging MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI).

**Testing the Application** 

In order to test the functionality of the application you will need 
to have access to medical images. Sample images from the MedMNIST dataset 
can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/medical-mnist).
